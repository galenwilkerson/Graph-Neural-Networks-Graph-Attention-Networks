# Graph Neural Networks and Graph Attention Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the usage of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) using the PyTorch Geometric library (`pyg`). The notebook covers various functionalities of the `pyg` library, including data handling, transformations, building, training, and evaluating GNN models, and visualizing the network and metrics.

## Repository Contents

- `GNNs_GATs.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook demonstrating the functionalities and implementation of GNNs and GATs.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torch-geometric matplotlib networkx
